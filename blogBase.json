The owner, Mrs. Smith, was very worried. Her purse was protected by her dog, but she was still afraid that the thieves might come back.\n \nThe police are now searching for the stolen goods. They believe the robbery was carefully planned. A witness said that one of the thieves was wearing a mask, so it was hard to see his face clearly. The thief seemed to be very careful, making sure not to leave any clues.\n \nThe police also suspect that the theft might be related to a recent string of robberies in the neighborhood. Robberies seem to take place almost every night in this area. People who commit such crimes usually end up in jail if they are caught.\n \nMrs. Smith hopes the police can find the thieves soon. She doesn't want to live in fear. She is also thinking about how to better protect her store in the future. Maybe she needs to buy a stronger lock or install more security cameras.\n \n\u914d\u5957\u7ec3\u4e60\u9898\n \n1.\u00a0What happened at the store last night?\nA. A fire.  B. A robbery.  C.

The police are now on the case, searching for the stolen necklace.\n \nThe thief entered the woman's house quietly. It's unknown whether he had an accomplice or not. The woman said she saw a man wearing a hat that looked like the one worn by the criminal in a recent news report. But she isn't certain if it was the same person.\n \nThe court has decided that a suspect they caught is innocent. He clearly isn't a criminal. This makes the case more complicated. The police are now trying to find new clues.\n \nIn case of any emergency during the investigation, the police have asked the public to call 911 and tell them if they get any information quickly. Fortunately, nothing else valuable was stolen from the woman's house. But she is still very upset about her lost necklace and hopes the police can solve the case soon.\n \n\u914d\u5957\u7ec3\u4e60\u9898\n \n1.\u00a0What was stolen from the woman?\nA. Her purse.  B.

Every year, we hold an annual family reunion. All my relatives will be meeting at our aunt's house. It's a time filled with warmth and joy.\n \nMy friends are very sociable. They love hanging out on the weekend. I often think about how people in other places celebrate holidays. For example, what are the customs for Independence Day in different towns?

Marilyn, for example, recently went inside a jewelry store, hoping to buy a new necklace. She hates not knowing where her jewelry comes from, so she was careful to ask the store staff about the origin of the items.\n \nWhen shopping, knowing your size is crucial. In clothing stores, there are often fitting rooms. As the saying goes, 'There's a fitting room over there if you want to try those clothes on.' Also, payment methods matter. You can pay for items with a credit card in many stores, but some only accept cash.\n \nThese days, I've been trying hard to avoid buying low - quality items. I've learned not to trust the mirrors in fitting rooms, as they can be misleading. I also check reviews before purchasing. Just the other day, I spent an hour checking the reviews of a product. My roommate, on the other hand, owes me one hundred dollars for rent. Financial matters like this sometimes affect our shopping decisions.\n \nQuestions:\n \n1.\u00a0Why did Marilyn go to the jewelry store?\n \n2.\u00a0What is important when shopping for clothes?\n \n3.\u00a0What has the author been trying to avoid recently?\n \n\u6587\u7ae0\u4e8c\uff1a Daily Life and Consumption\n \nIn my daily life, money and consumption play significant roles. I don't mind buying expensive shoes if they are of high quality. However, I'm always on the lookout for bargains. Today, there aren't many items on sale, which is a bit disappointing.\n \nWhen it comes to payment, I prefer using my credit card. But I was surprised to find that some stores only accept cash. After shopping, it's important to keep the receipt. You shouldn't leave the store without checking it.\n \nI'm also concerned about the quality of products. This sweater is made of completely natural materials, which is why I bought it. My bank account is running low; I only have two dollars left. I'm now considering using shopping cards. I hope I can find some good deals before my money runs out completely.\n \nQuestions:\n \n1.\u00a0What kind of shoes does the author not mind buying?\n \n2.\u00a0What should you do after shopping?\n \n3.\u00a0Why does the author have little money left in the bank account?\n \n\u6587\u7ae0\u4e09\uff1a A Day of Shopping and Reflection\n \nYesterday was a busy day of shopping. I first visited a clothing store. I was looking for some new underwear. The store had a wide selection, but I had to be careful about the quality. I've been deceived by low - quality items before.\n \nThen, I went to a furniture store. I liked the wooden frame in the yard. It reminded me of the time I spent in Italy ten years ago. Memories often come back when we see certain things.\n \nAfter that, I stopped by a music store. I heard my neighbor playing an instrument. It was so beautiful that I almost bought one for myself. But I remembered that I had to pay my rent. My roommate still owes me money, and I need to get the total amount with tax sorted out.\n \nQuestions:\n \n1.\u00a0What did the author look for in the clothing store?\n \n2.\u00a0What reminded the author of Italy?\n \n3.\u00a0Why didn't the author buy an instrument?\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1742777440, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-03-24", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}, "P22": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Exercise for reading 27.3.2025.html", "labels": ["Exercise for reading"], "postTitle": "Exercise for reading 27.3.2025", "postUrl": "post/Exercise%20for%20reading%2027.3.2025.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/zane-p-f/zane-p-f.github.io/issues/22", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 3840, "description": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4e00\u53ca\u7ec3\u4e60\u9898\n\u6587\u7ae0\u4e00\uff1aA Memorable European Trip\nThe Smith family is on an exciting journey to Europe. They are staying in a luxury hotel in Paris, indulging in the charm of the city. Before the trip, they had many considerations. If they didn't like traveling by train, they thought about taking a plane. They aimed to learn some history during their visit.\nThey debated about transportation. They could take the ferry to an island, but wondered if it would be delayed. Booking the ferry meant going by sea, and they knew it would be easier if they took the highway. They also considered flight options. Passengers on Flight 31 would begin boarding in about 5 minutes. They were concerned about layovers, asking if it was possible to fly to Chicago without one. Luckily, there was a direct flight from their departure city.\nThey were also dealing with accommodation. They booked a luxury apartment for a week. They knew that wherever they went, they might need to book a hotel close to the airport, as one of them always got lost. They even thought about starting by staying at a hostel until they found a more suitable place.\nMoney - related matters were also on their minds. They knew they might need to do currency exchange. They discussed whether it would be cheaper to buy round - trip tickets. They were worried about prices going up, so they hurried to book flights in advance.\n\u7ec3\u4e60\u9898\nWhere is the Smith family staying in Paris?\nA. A hostel B. A luxury hotel C.

First, you have to decide on transportation. You might consider taking a cruise on a big ship across the ocean, which is a very unique experience. If you're in a hurry, flying might be a better option. But flights can be confusing. For example, passengers in Rows A to F may board the plane at a certain time, and you need to know when your flight departs. You might also wonder if there are direct flights to your destination, or if you'll have a layover.\nAccommodation is another big decision. You could stay in a luxury hotel or apartment, enjoying the comfort and service. Or, if you're on a budget, hostels can be a great choice. You can meet interesting people there. Wherever you choose to stay, location matters. If you often get lost like some travelers, booking a place near the airport might be wise.\nWhen it comes to costs, you need to think about currency exchange if you're traveling abroad. You might also consider whether one - way or round - trip tickets are more cost - effective. And don't forget to book in advance to avoid price hikes.\n\u7ec3\u4e60\u9898\nWhat is a unique way to travel across the ocean according to the article?\nA. Taking a plane B. Taking a train C.
