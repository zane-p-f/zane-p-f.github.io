The Robbery at the Store
 
Last night, there was a robbery at the store. The owner, Mrs. Smith, was very worried. Her purse was protected by her dog, but she was still afraid that the thieves might come back.
 
The police are now searching for the stolen goods. They believe the robbery was carefully planned. A witness said that one of the thieves was wearing a mask, so it was hard to see his face clearly. The thief seemed to be very careful, making sure not to leave any clues.
 
The police also suspect that the theft might be related to a recent string of robberies in the neighborhood. Robberies seem to take place almost every night in this area. People who commit such crimes usually end up in jail if they are caught.
 
Mrs. Smith hopes the police can find the thieves soon. She doesn't want to live in fear. She is also thinking about how to better protect her store in the future. Maybe she needs to buy a stronger lock or install more security cameras.
