阅读文章一：The Family Tradition
 
In our family, there is a special custom that has been passed down for generations, yet no one knows how it began. Every year, we hold an annual family reunion. All my relatives will be meeting at our aunt's house. It's a time filled with warmth and joy.
 
My friends are very sociable. They love hanging out on the weekend. I often think about how people in other places celebrate holidays. For example, what are the customs for Independence Day in different towns? Here, we have our own unique ways.
 
I'm really looking forward to the family reunion this year. I was a bit worried that I couldn't make it here earlier, but I'm sure I'll make it to the event. Nia is about to leave work. She's turning off her computer, getting ready to join in the fun as well.
