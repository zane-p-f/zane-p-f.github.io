Movies are a big part of people's entertainment. Romantic movies usually end with a kiss, which is a common scene. A lot of people go to the movie theater, but some, like Tom, rarely visit these days. He doesn't like sitting behind someone who uses their phone during the movie. There was a big film festival last month, and many interesting movies were shown. One of the movies was set in France in the 18th century. It had a long - and - complicated plot.
