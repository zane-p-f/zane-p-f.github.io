文章一： Shopping Experiences
 
Shopping is an essential part of our lives. Marilyn, for example, recently went inside a jewelry store, hoping to buy a new necklace. She hates not knowing where her jewelry comes from, so she was careful to ask the store staff about the origin of the items.
 
When shopping, knowing your size is crucial. In clothing stores, there are often fitting rooms. As the saying goes, "There's a fitting room over there if you want to try those clothes on." Also, payment methods matter. You can pay for items with a credit card in many stores, but some only accept cash.
 
These days, I've been trying hard to avoid buying low - quality items. I've learned not to trust the mirrors in fitting rooms, as they can be misleading. I also check reviews before purchasing. Just the other day, I spent an hour checking the reviews of a product. My roommate, on the other hand, owes me one hundred dollars for rent. Financial matters like this sometimes affect our shopping decisions.
 
Questions:
 
1. Why did Marilyn go to the jewelry store?
 
2. What is important when shopping for clothes?
 
3. What has the author been trying to avoid recently?
 
文章二： Daily Life and Consumption
 
In my daily life, money and consumption play significant roles. I don't mind buying expensive shoes if they are of high quality. However, I'm always on the lookout for bargains. Today, there aren't many items on sale, which is a bit disappointing.
 
When it comes to payment, I prefer using my credit card. But I was surprised to find that some stores only accept cash. After shopping, it's important to keep the receipt. You shouldn't leave the store without checking it.
 
I'm also concerned about the quality of products. This sweater is made of completely natural materials, which is why I bought it. My bank account is running low; I only have two dollars left. I'm now considering using shopping cards. I hope I can find some good deals before my money runs out completely.
 
Questions:
 
1. What kind of shoes does the author not mind buying?
 
2. What should you do after shopping?
 
3. Why does the author have little money left in the bank account?
 
文章三： A Day of Shopping and Reflection
 
Yesterday was a busy day of shopping. I first visited a clothing store. I was looking for some new underwear. The store had a wide selection, but I had to be careful about the quality. I've been deceived by low - quality items before.
 
Then, I went to a furniture store. I liked the wooden frame in the yard. It reminded me of the time I spent in Italy ten years ago. Memories often come back when we see certain things.
 
After that, I stopped by a music store. I heard my neighbor playing an instrument. It was so beautiful that I almost bought one for myself. But I remembered that I had to pay my rent. My roommate still owes me money, and I need to get the total amount with tax sorted out.
 
Questions:
 
1. What did the author look for in the clothing store?
 
2. What reminded the author of Italy?
 
3. Why didn't the author buy an instrument?
