In our family, there is a special custom that has been passed down for generations, yet no one knows how it began. Every year, we hold an annual family reunion. All my relatives will be meeting at our aunt's house. It's a time filled with warmth and joy.
 
My friends are very sociable. They love hanging out on the weekend. I often think about how people in other places celebrate holidays. For example, what are the customs for Independence Day in different towns? Here, we have our own unique ways.
 
I'm really looking forward to the family reunion this year. I was a bit worried that I couldn't make it here earlier, but I'm sure I'll make it to the event. Nia is about to leave work. She's turning off her computer, getting ready to join in the fun as well.

The Robbery at the Store
 
Last night, there was a robbery at the store. The owner, Mrs. Smith, was very worried. Her purse was protected by her dog, but she was still afraid that the thieves might come back.
 
The police are now searching for the stolen goods. They believe the robbery was carefully planned. A witness said that one of the thieves was wearing a mask, so it was hard to see his face clearly. The thief seemed to be very careful, making sure not to leave any clues.
 
The police also suspect that the theft might be related to a recent string of robberies in the neighborhood. Robberies seem to take place almost every night in this area. People who commit such crimes usually end up in jail if they are caught.
 
Mrs. Smith hopes the police can find the thieves soon. She doesn't want to live in fear. She is also thinking about how to better protect her store in the future. Maybe she needs to buy a stronger lock or install more security cameras.

The Stolen Necklace
 
A woman's necklace was stolen recently. She reported it to the police immediately. The police are now on the case, searching for the stolen necklace.
 
The thief entered the woman's house quietly. It's unknown whether he had an accomplice or not. The woman said she saw a man wearing a hat that looked like the one worn by the criminal in a recent news report. But she isn't certain if it was the same person.
 
The court has decided that a suspect they caught is innocent. He clearly isn't a criminal. This makes the case more complicated. The police are now trying to find new clues.
 
In case of any emergency during the investigation, the police have asked the public to call 911 and tell them if they get any information quickly. Fortunately, nothing else valuable was stolen from the woman's house. But she is still very upset about her lost necklace and hopes the police can solve the case soon.
